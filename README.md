The file trust.py is the code sample for calcultating the the various trust values discussed in the paper between any two nodes. For simplicity, the social factors have been manualy entered and thus the local trust values have been computed accordingly. All the values, terms have been explained in the paper. 

The folder 5 node and 10 node consists of  simple plots of the local and global trust values for a graph of 5 nodes and 10 nodes respectively. The other two screenshots in the 10 node folder are the computed values for the graph of 10 nodes.
